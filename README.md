# Debate Notes
Alex Vergara (11/30/23)

*A comprehensive list of definitions and resources for philosophical debates.*

## Terminology

**Debate:**

* Axiomatic - Self evident

* Tautology - The saying of the same thing twice in different words
* Fallibility - The tendency to make mistakes or to be wrong
* Elucidate - Make something clear/explain
* Straw man - an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent’s real argument.
* Ad hominem - a personal attack directed at someone rather than a position they hold
* Empiricism - the idea that all knowledge is derived from sense experience (observational evidence)
* Confirmation Bias - the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one’s existing beliefs or theories
* Non-inferential - no inference, a baseless claim
* Non-Sequitur - a conclusion or statement that does not logically follow from the previous argument
* Volition - by one’s own will
* Axiom - an indemonstrable first principle, rule, or maxim, that is generally accepted.
* Freudian slip - an unintentional error regarded as revealing subconscious feelings.
* Veracity - conformity to facts; accuracy.
* Gish gallop - a rhetorical technique in which a person in a debate attempts to overwhelm their opponent by providing an excessive number of arguments with no regard for the accuracy or strength of those arguments.
* Infinite regress - An infinite series of entities governed by a recursive principle that determines how each entity in the series depends on or is produced by its predecessor. (EX: the idea that god doesn’t have a creator would lock one into an infinite regression)
* Inductive reasoning - a logical process in which multiple premises, all believed true or found true most of the time, are combined to obtain a specific conclusion.
* Deductive reasoning - a logical process in which a conclusion is based on the concordance of multiple premises that are generally assumed to be true.
* Composition/Division Fallacy - The fallacy of composition consists in treating a distributed characteristic as if it were collective. It occurs when one makes the mistake of attributing to a group (or a whole) some characteristic that is true only of its individual members (or its parts), and then makes inferences based on that mistake.
* Sunk-cost Fallacy - The phenomenon whereby a person is reluctant to abandon a strategy or course of action because they have invested heavily in it, even when it is clear that abandonment would be more beneficial.

**Philosophy:**

* Ontology - Study of the nature of being (metaphysics)

* Teleology - Study of purpose, an explanation of something in terms of the purpose they serve. (Means to the end)
* Epistemology - Theory of knowledge
* Metaphysics - The branch of philosophy that deals with the first principles of things, abstract concepts such as being, knowing, substance, cause, identity, time and space.
* Syllogism - a kind of logical argument that utilizes deductive reasoning along with two premises and a conclusion.
* Fallibilist - the epistemological thesis that no belief (theory, view, thesis, and so on) can ever be rationally supported or justified in a conclusive way. Always, there remains a possible doubt as to the truth of the belief.
* Nominative Determinism - the theory that people are psychologically predisposed to pursue occupations or interests that resemble or evoke their names in some way.
* Solipsism - the idea that only one’s own mind is sure too exist; frowned upon (who created the mind?)
* Epistemic solipsism - the claim that one can only be sure of the existence of one's mind. The existence of other minds and the external world is not necessarily rejected but one can not be sure of its existence.
* Dualism - the division of something conceptually into two opposed or contrasted aspects, or the state of being so divided.
* social contract theory ?

***Laws of Logic:***


1. `The Law of Identity` - anything that has been determined to be true, must be identical to itself and different from other things.

2. `The Law of Non-Contradiction` - if something is true it cannot NOT be true at the same time. In other words a truth cannot be false.

3. `The Law of Excluded Middle` - defined as there being no “middle man” in-between a truth or falsity; one is either correct or it’s not.

**Biology:**

* Gene duplication and genetic drift, two well-known mechanisms which both ADD genetic information.

* Corporeal - relating to a person's body, especially as opposed to their spirit.
* Qualia - the internal and subjective component of sense perceptions, arising from stimulation of the senses by phenomena. 
* Monogenesis - the theory that humans are all descended from a single pair of ancestors.

**Misc:**

* Autodidact - someone who is self learned / self taught.
